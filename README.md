# New_York_Food_Inspection_Data_Engineering

## Summary
This project encompasses the development of end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) data pipelines for the New York Food Inspection dataset in Tab-Separated Values (.tsv) format, comprising a total of 242,408 records. 

## Tasks performed
- 1. Data Profiling and Analysis
Tools Used: Alteryx
Description: Understanding, organizing, and analyzing the New York Food Inspection dataset to identify important trends and patterns.

- 2. Data Modeling
Tools Used: ER/Studio
Description: Creating a structured data model comprising 9 dimensions and 2 facts to effectively represent the dataset. Generated DDL scripts to implement the model in databases.

- 3. Data Pipeline Creation
Tools Used: Talend
Description: Constructed an end-to-end data pipeline to manage over 200,000 records. This pipeline facilitated data staging, cleaning, transformation, and loading into MySQL and Azure PostgreSQL databases.

- 4. Data Validation and Visualization
Tools Used: SQL, Tableau, Power BI
Description: Validated data integrity using SQL queries. Developed visualizations using Tableau and Power BI to showcase insights on inspection trends, success rates, and evolving outcomes over time.
